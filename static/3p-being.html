Paragraph Summary of Hegel’s Theory of Being</h1>
<p>Being is immediacy (stasis, abiding, inoperation). At first, being is
(1.) pure, abstract being. If pure being is affected by a negation, then
it is (2.) existence. An existent is a qualified being, a quale
(Aristotle’s ‘poion’). Every existing being (every tree, rock, person,
etc.) is a quale. Insofar as they exist (i.e. have out-being) they are
separate from each other and limited by each other. The meadow begins
where the forest ends. Existence thus consists in the opposition of
something and another, one quale defined negatively in relation to
another quale. The sublation (simultaneous transcendence and
preservation) of this recalcitrance in existence is (3.) self-existence:
infinite being, being self-relation. This is the third to pure being and
existence, a return to pure being with limit, finitude, and relative
determination sublated. Self-existence thus has the distinct feature of
sublating otherness, of taking up all finitude, limit, disunity, etc.
and bringing it back into the one (this sublating is Aristotle’s ‘pros
hen’). On account of having negativity brought back into it, the one
(pure being united to negativity) generates many ones (1, 1, 1). But the
being of these ones is just as immediately sublated, and they are
reunited in the one. The one multiplies, and its multiplications are
accumulated back into the unit again. This is quantity.</p>
<p>Quantity (Aristotle’s ‘poson’) is the unique quale, which has the
distinctive feature of surpassing all limitation, going over every
boundary, ranging over many ones, and accumulating them back into the
unity. First we have (1.) pure quantity. Repetition is the source of
discreteness in pure quantity, accumulation the source of continuity.
Affected by a negation, pure quantity is (2.) a number, a quantum
(e.g. 5, 9). A quantum is implicitly a combination of unit (what is
counted) and amount (the count). The course of quantity is that these
sides are brought into explicit self-relation. Quantum can be extensive
or intensive (e.g. an intense pigment can cover a more extensive surface
area). The forms of combination of quanta are the series of ordinary
arithmetic operations (+, -, ·, ÷). (The operator actually represents
the implicit qualitative element in quantity.) But the connection
between quanta (e.g. 5 + 2) is just arbitrary, unless there would be a
third quantum to stabilize their relation. This third in which two
quanta are held together, is (3.) the ratio (e.g. 10 : 2). One side of
the ratio is unit, the other side is amount. The relation is the
implicit qualitative element. When division produces infinite decimals
(2/7 = 0.2857…) this is because it is an inadequate expression of the
qualitative element in quantity, an unquantifiable beyond which can only
be held together by the ratio. Ratio comes in three varieties: In the
direct ratio (k = x/y), x and y must increase linearly to maintain k. In
the inverse ratio (k = x⋅y), when x increases y must decrease, and vice
versa. Ratio in general is the self-relation of quantum. But only in the
ratio of powers (x = y²) does this self-relation become complete,
absolute. In exponentiation the unit and the amount are the same. The
square can be analyzed back into its factors through the square root,
which is impossible in division, etc. because the quotient or product is
only arbitrarily related to its factors. With the ratio of powers
quantum has become self-referential, has recaptured its qualitative
beyond and we thus circle back to quality.</p>
<p>Measure is the combination of quality and quantity, a quantity with
qualitative meaning. If one changes the other changes as well (5 books
is a collection but 100 books is a library). In quantity we saw unit and
amount become united and self-related; in measure, the same development
happens, but with quality and quantity. Measure is first (1.) a specific
quantum, in which the quantum is extrinsically united to the quale and
thus somewhat arbitrary (100 books in a library, 1000 hairs on a head).
These can be compared (1 table : 5 books wide). But in (2.) real
measure, the quantum is intrinsic to the quale (e.g. the specific
gravity of gold is 19.3). Combination of real measures results in
surprising changes (e.g. combining ethylene glycol and water results in
an overall reduction of volume in the mixture). Now we see that it is
the quantitative element in quality which makes qualia combinable.
Without the quantitative side, qualia just destroy each other as we saw
in pure quality. In measure, the two qualia (with intrinsic quanta) are
combined like the addends of an equation (1 oxygen + 2 hydrogen =
water). The estimation of this capacity for combination is elective
affinity (e.g. chemical affinity, and also musical harmony). Finally we
have the nodal line, in which the sudden jump from quantitative to
qualitative change is intrinsic to the quale (e.g. temperature change
causes phase change: solid, liquid, gas). With this the alternating
determinations of quality and quantity reciprocally sublate each other
in a third, which is (3.) the substrate underlying all qualitative and
quantitative change. This substrate stands to alternating quality and
quantity as the product of the inverse ratio stands to its factors. The
substrate is the fixity, the abiding being which is the extrinsic limit
which sublates the two terms of the relation. But the substrate is
itself this sublation, the infinite retraction of itself into itself and
putting itself forth again. This is substance, essence.</p>
