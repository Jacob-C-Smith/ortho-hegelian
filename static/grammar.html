Hegel</h1>
<p>I thought I would endeavor to say succinctly what Hegel’s philosophy
is, and the reason for the high status afforded to logic therein.</p>
<p>The natural world confronting scientific consciousness evidences what
is called the hierarchy or ‘great chain’ of being. Human beings are more
complex or ‘higher’ than animals, animals higher than plants, and so on
down to inanimate things, rocks and the like. It may be noted that this
is the philosophical origin and ground of the theory of evolution, which
contributes only the thought of historical development, and thus
introduces considerations which are secondary to the pure science of the
chain in and of itself or in its concept.</p>
<p>It was Aristotle who first put forth the definition of man as zōon
logon echon, the animal that has the logos, the word or reason. Reason,
the power of thinking and speaking, is laid down as the essence of man.
Now if it is further granted that in the great chain of being man is at
the top, and that the top is the end and purpose of the whole, then it
follows straightaway from what has been said that reason, thinking, is
the essence of the world, of natural and human history, and the essence
of being in general.</p>
<p>At this point I will venture to say what this reason, this logos is
more precisely, and especially more concretely than is usually done,
that is in the fullness and wealth of its inner content. Our most
proximate acquaintance with reason in its general externality is the
experience of human language and communication, of which this letter is
a convenient example. The science of language, conceived as the
externalization of thinking, is grammar. And grammar is to language as
logic is to pure thought. Inasmuch as language is the expression of
thinking, then grammar is the expression of the science of logic, or
grammar is logic as seen through a glass darkly.</p>
<p>The content of grammar is roughly as follows: parts of speech (nouns,
verbs, adjectives, and so on), sentence structure (subject and
predicate), adjective order (opinion, size, age, etc.), modal verbs
(does, can do, must do), articles and determiners (a, an, the), word
order (subject, verb, object), object direction (direct and indirect
objects), voice (passive and active), conditionals (if, then, when). It
can be seen that this content corresponds roughly to the content of
logic, and as we will see later, classical metaphysics too. Each word
corresponds to a concept; a sentence is a combination of words that
expresses a judgment. A judgment is a connection of two concepts through
the copula (the ‘is’ or being). Speaking is the stringing together of
sentences, as reasoning is the stringing together of judgments.</p>
<p>It has just been said that grammar is the expression of logic, and
that if an essential structure can be discerned in grammar in general,
then a corresponding structure must be discovered as part of the content
of the science of logic. I will now show that this necessitates an
expanded conception of logic from how it is traditionally conceived.
Every language, even those without a definite class of adjectives, has a
way of performing the basic function of the adjective, which is to
exhibit the quality or attribute of a noun. And it can be seen that
despite great variability, there is a more or less consistent ordering
of adjectives across languages, Eastern and Western.</p>
<p>Take for example the sentence, “that is one beautiful big red
Canadian racing bicycle.” The ordering of adjectives is roughly:
quantity (one), quality or opinion (beautiful), size (big), age (new),
color (red), origin (Canadian), purpose (racing), substantive (bicycle).
In some languages the adjectives come after the substantive, often in an
order which is a reverse of the English ordering. In some languages,
some of the adjectives appear before the substantive, and some after. A
wide variety of exceptions can be discerned. But an exception does not
destroy the rule, as is sometimes thought. The general pattern is this:
the adjectives which occur closer to the substantive are more essential
to it, i.e. more concerning its inward and necessary nature, whereas the
adjectives which occur further away from the substantive in the sentence
are more superficial, more external and thus more accidental.</p>
<p>The foregoing may be regarded as evidence that the science of logic
must contain within it also a science of essence, that is, a science of
the classes of qualities which have more or less extrinsic and intrinsic
existence relative to the substance. Nouns, the substantive part of
speech, correspond to what in metaphysics are called substances or
essences (ousíai in Greek), which were traditionally defined as what is
not said of (predicated of) anything else. These are more definitely
individuals, for example this pencil here on my desk or Alexander the
Great. Moreover, adjectives correspond to what in classical metaphysics
were called qualities, which are primarily predicated of another and
thus have only derivative being. The general conclusion to be gleaned
from this is that the basic structures of the grammar, the relations of
subject and predicate, indeed correspond to the distinction between
substance and accident, essential and inessential qualities, in
metaphysics, and subject and object in logic.</p>
<p>The content of logic and metaphysics also includes a theory of
modality. The three forms of modality are generally, actual or
assertoric (he does it), possible or problematic (he might do it, could
do it), and necessary or apodictic (he must, has to do it). This theory,
which is both logical and metaphysical, corresponds to modal verbs in
the grammar. The subject matter in grammar of voice (the dog chased the
ball vs. the ball was chased by the dog) also reflects the theory of
passivity and activity in metaphysics. This also corresponds to the
reversal of ordering of subject and object in the sentence. The related
topic of indirect and direct objects in the grammar reflects the
difference between judgments and syllogisms, or two- and three-term
judgments (he gave a gift vs. he gave his sister a gift), and to the
mediation of substances generally, one substance to another via a third.
This is explicit in the syllogism of traditional logic (Socrates is a
man, all men are mortal, therefore Socrates is mortal). Lastly,
conditional statements in the grammar correspond to hypothetical
judgments in pure logic (if the grass is wet, then it has rained), and
relations of cause and effect in metaphysics.</p>
<p>Now before we proceed it may be worthwhile to remove some confusions
which commonly arise regarding the status of logic (all of the
foregoing) with respect to the world. It is sometimes thought that logic
is only an abstraction from all worldly reality, by which is meant that
it only comes to the world after the fact, as something tacked on as it
were to reality, rather than being the world’s eternal and inward
essence. But the common view is not how things stand in fact. Because
what is unchanging and necessary cannot be extracted from the contingent
and temporal, just as ends cannot be extracted from mere means, unless
the former were present in them implicitly all along. This is known in
Aristotle’s philosophy as the priority in substance of actuality over
potency. No proposition could be more important for science. To give an
example from experience: everyone knows that the seed emerges in the
fruit at the end of the cycle of reproduction of a tree. And it also
occurs to everyone that this seed is not a spontaneous emergence from
nowhere, but rather definitely a re-emergence of the one present from
the beginning as the tree’s first cause. The logos (the whole content of
logic and metaphysics just exhibited) is to be taken in the same way, as
at first pre-existing before time, then as submerged in the externality
of nature (analogous to the branches and leaves), and thirdly as
re-emerging in the product, the fruit, which is likewise the human
being, the rational animal. And this re-emergence is the chain of being
that was referred to at the beginning of this essay.</p>
<p>We have illustrated the relation of the content of classical
metaphysics—the ground structures of reality—to the sciences of thinking
and language, logic and grammar, and to the world in general and man’s
position in it, to anthropology. This is the whole circle of science.
The appearance of the logos in man is to be taken as the re-emergence in
time of logic out of its submergence (its implicitude) in nature, in
unthinking organisms. The great chain of being, manifest in the history
of the natural and human worlds, is on the one hand an interiorizing
development, in which the inner logos is recollected out of the
externality of space and time; and on other hand as an externalization
of the same logical concept in the activity and work of the human being.
The merely external—the soulless and irrational—has proceeded from its
essence, from logic, and in the human being has returned back to that
essence, back to the logos or God, just as adjectives proceed from and
return to, in the judgment, the nouns from which they derive their
being, a relationship of dependence which is made explicit in the
elements of grammar. And the seed in the plant may be called its
concept, and the leaves that it puts forth (posits) are likewise its
predicates, its attributes. This movement corresponds to what in the
Thomistic philosophy was called the exitus et reditus, the exit from and
return to God.</p>
<p>With one final comment I will bring to conclusion this brief overview
of the circle of treasures that constitutes the science of philosophy.
The average, ordinary definition of God (which even atheists will
readily assent to) contains implicitly all the foregoing categories of
logic and metaphysics, rolled up in it as it were. God is generally
defined as the infinite, omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent,
omnipresent, divine legislator, supremely beautiful, and the truth
itself. It can be seen that this definition contains all the content of
the science of logic in one. God’s infinity and oneness are his basic
quality and quantity. His external quality is his supreme beauty. His
origin is his own self: that he is the causa sui. This is likewise his
omnipotence, his infinite causal power. His status as legislator is his
modality: he is infinitely necessary being, necessitation itself. His
omnipresence is his infinite activity, by which he continues himself
into his creation. His perfection is his ideality: that he knows himself
to be the absolute purpose, the end in itself. And this is likewise his
omniscience, that he is the infinite self-comprehending being, the
concept. He is thus the subject of the world and of history; the
plurality of beings encountered in finite reality, in this world, are
his predicates. The most essential of these predicates is the individual
human being, who is just as equally the essence of being in and of
itself, the power of thinking and speaking: reason, God or logos. Thus
the whole of science is a circle in which the logos puts forth its inner
content in the natural world, in space and time, and then recollects
itself back into itself, thus re-emerging from submergence in nature as
the human being, the animal with reason.</p>
