<h2 id="section-i-quality">Section I: Quality</h2>
<h3 id="a.-being">A. Being</h3>
<p><strong>Being, Nothing, Becoming</strong> <strong>Being.</strong>
Being, pure being. Pure being is completely ineffable. It is totally
lacking in articulation or determination. Consequently there is nothing
to be said of it. Or rather, there is nothing to be said of it, and so
we pass to nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Nothing.</strong> Nothing is sheer emptiness, total absence
of articulation. Nothing is outright ineffable and unspeakable. Or it is
ineffable and unspeakable. Consequently it is the same emptiness as
being, and so we pass back to being.</p>
<p><strong>Becoming.</strong> Being passes to nothing and nothing to
being. The former passage is ceasing-to-be and the latter is
coming-to-be. Together they are the two directions of becoming. But
becoming exhibits this self-contradiction: if all is becoming, then
becoming itself becomes, and consequently cancels itself as becoming.
Therefore we have the ceasing-to-be of becoming and thereby being that
has come to be. This is entitence. (This is a very hard transition.
Because it is like the fall of man. We fall from the purity of of pure
being into the externality of that which is. We fall from the gerund to
the participle. From being to the being.)</p>
<h3 id="b.-entitence">B. Entitence</h3>
<p><strong>a. Entitence, Quality, Something</strong></p>
<p><strong>Entitence in general.</strong> When we point at something and
say ‘there’ or ‘that’, our attention converges on a certain point;
perception fixes on a definite spot. The same thing occurs at the level
of language or thinking in general through the grammatical determiner:
the, this, that, etc. This is what we mean by ‘Dasein’. Dasein is
there-being, that-being, the-being, etc. - being determined in some way.
(If one desires an absolute example of Dasein, the following could be
given: God’s incarnation in 1 AD in Bethlehem is his Dasein, his being
confined to a determinate place and time. But more generally and
abstractly, Dasein is just the determination of anything at all.) We
have established the meaning of Dasein as the ontological category that
corresponds the grammatical determiner in language. Now the question is
how to adequately render the word ‘Dasein’ in English, given that there
seems to be as yet no such word. The the most basic kind of determiner
in the English language is the definite article: the word ‘the’. Dasein,
as determinate being, is basically and primarily the being. Now this is
also how we translate Aristotle’s το όν. Thus, the difference between
Sein and Dasein is the same as the difference between όν and το όν,
being and the being. The being consists of beings, each of which is a
being, an entity. Therefore, Dasein is the state of being an entity. It
is entityhood in general, entitency or entitence. Its participle is the
entitent – but now we have advanced too far. Entitence is being mixed
with nothing, being with a nonbeing (Sein with a ‘da’ or όν with a το).
This nonbeing, this abstract determination, is, as we said, the
determiner in general: the ‘the’, ‘that’, ‘there’, ‘then’ etc. Now the
further determination of entitence, its closer examination, is the
reflection on entitence. But this cannot be a merely external
reflection. It must be entitence’s own reflection. Now a reflection is a
questioning, an interrogation. Accordingly, the further development of
entitence, its ensuing deduction, consists in its own immanent
interrogation. When we inquire for further determination in general we
ask what?, which?, where? In other words we switch from the
demonstrative to the interrogative. This is the immanent reflection of
entitence, its own negativity, the determining of the determination. It
is the same as switching the order from determinate being to being
determinate; from which is to is which; from that is to is that; from
what is to is what. The negation in entitence, its reflection or
interrogation, is what-being – quality.</p>
<p><strong>Quality.</strong> Entitence is being mixed with nonbeing. If
we single out the nonbeing in entitence, it is the determination in it,
i.e. the minimal negation which distinguishes entitence from pure being.
Entitence’s determination is what-being, quality. Quality translates
Aristotle’s ποιόν, “of what kind?” “what sort?”. (This is to be
distinguished from τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι, the what-it-was-being, which means
essence, Wesen; or in Old English, wesan as opposed to bēon.) If we are
curious about something indeterminate, we expand our knowledge with
further determination by asking for qualities: what is it? where is it?
when is it?, and so forth. We make judgments such as, ‘A is triangular’,
‘B is not red’. That is determination and qualification. But for every
qualitative affirmation (reality), a negation is immediately implied. If
A is triangular, it is not rectangular, and so on. If it is in Rome it
is not in Constantinople. Quality is thus this dualism between reality
and negation. This is the dualism, the reflection implicit in entitence
in general. Now the deduction to the next category is made through the
sublation (simultaneous preservation and cancellation) of the just
mentioned duality of quality. The deduction more precisely is as
follows: reality (‘is A’) in-itself implies negation, and so is a
mixture of being and nonbeing, and therefore is entitence rather than
pure being; negation (‘is not A’) for its part implies reality, and so
is mixed being and nonbeing and thus is entitence rather than pure
nothing. Therefore, in entitence, its qualifying determinations, reality
and negation, are themselves entitent, are entities. Therefore entitence
is self-relating, applies to itself. Entitence is entitent, is an
entity, something. (This is a hard transition, but the following
observation may help: entitence in general has the character of
universality; quality is the difference in it, its particularity; and
the unity of these is the singular: entitence restored to universality
through the particularization: an entity.)</p>
<p><strong>Something.</strong> Entitence is itself (is self-equal);
quality is its self-negation (self-inequality); and something is the
negation of negation (entitence again self-equal through the reflection,
the interrogation). Entitence is the being of something, that it is,
quality is what it is, and something is that it is this (Aristotle’s
τόδε τι). Something is the utterly elementary ontological subject
(ὑποκείμενον). As the ‘I’, is to the level of thought, spirit, etc.; and
as the living is to the level of life, nature; so the entitent, entity,
is to the level of entitence. As the sublation of the reflection in
entitence, something is freshly immediate, unreflective. It has the
foregoing determinations sublated in it. The nothingness contained in
something is also an entity, a something, and can be brought out and
focused on: something else, an other. The moment of becoming is
contained in something in the form of change: something changes into
something else. These are the three determinations of something. At the
basis of all this lies the simple relation-to-self, negation of
negation. This self-negativity is what the something is in-itself,
intrinsically. When it is brought out, when the sides of the negativity
are distinguished, it is the relation of something to something else, an
other, and the negativity is the relation between them. This relativity
is in fact what keeps entitence from falling back into pure being on the
one hand, but on the other hand also from raising itself up to infinity,
to self-entitation. To this relativity we now turn.</p>
<p><strong>b. Finitude: Otherness, Limit, Restriction</strong></p>
<p><strong>Something &amp; Other.</strong> In the previous section we
considered entitence in its positive forms. These were entitence in
general, quality, and something. Here we are to think the negative,
relational side of the matter. First of all, 1) ‘something’ immediately
implies ‘something else’, an other. The grammatical atoms ‘this’ and
‘that’ correspond to something and other respectively. But the something
is really the other of the other. Each is simultaneously other and
something, that and this. The distinction between them thus hinges on
the relation between them, and is accordingly relative. Now we consider
2) the relativity of something and other. The relation here is called
being-for-another, extrinsicness, or simply “the for-another.” This is
relation which extends from either of the two somethings towards its
other. It is relative determination: being determined through the
relation to another. (What a stick is a for a tree is different from
what it is for a dog, and for an old man, and so on.) In contrast to
this relatedness we have the non-relation, or immediate
relation-to-self: this is being-in-itself, intrinsic being. We have four
categories to think of: something and other, and in-itself and
for-another. ‘For-another’ does not mean that the other owns the first
something; rather it is simply the first something’s own outward-facing
relation, its relation-to-another. Each of the somethings thus has both
relations: self-equality (in-itself) and self-inequality (for-another).
Thus there are six elements here: the two somethings, and the two
relations belonging to each. 3) The in-itself and the for-another are
thus united in the something’s in-itself. Being-in-itself and
being-for-another are the same. For this fresh category Hegel employs
the term ‘determination’ (Bestimmung), not in the sense we’ve used it
above but in its peculiar sense of sending something beyond itself
(e.g. ‘predetermined’, ‘predestined’, etc.). Something’s determination
is its intrinsic extrinsicness, its being-intrinsically-for-another. The
opposite relation, being-extrinsically-its-in-itself, Hegel calls
‘constitution’. To these categories and their interrelation we now
turn.</p>
<p><strong>Determination &amp; Constitution.</strong> In the previous
section, something was considered in-itself and in-relation-to. In this
section we think the qualitative element in terms of this in-itself and
in-relation-to. If the relation-to-another is thought of as belonging to
the in-itself, then that is 1) a determination. Determination is the
for-another that obtains on the in-itself. The determination of a hammer
is to driving nails. This has a normative connotation: it ought to do
it. The being of anything ought to accord with its determination,
i.e. its entitence ought to correspond to its determination. This
immediately implies that the entitence has a qualitative determination
with which it may or may not be congruent. This extrinsic and fungible
side of something is called its 2) constitution, as in e.g. constitution
of the air in th sense of its quality: clear or polluted; or the
constitution of wood, hard or soft. The constitution of something has
bearing on its determination. The wood’s determination is to be for
building, but if it is too soft then it fails to be congruent with its
determination. (Hegel’s term for constitution is ‘Beschaffenheit’, a
word he also uses, in his Lectures on the History of Philosophy, to
translate Aristotle’s ἕξις; but perhaps it could also be called
disposition, διάθεσις). Determination and constitution are therefore
inseparable, and thus fall in a third, which is a quality, a
determination that is at once intrinsic and extrinsic to the something.
This is that qualification that is at once on the surface of the thing
and also, just by being on the surface, defines it intrinsically,
defines its in-itself. This is 3) limit. Limit unites the somethings as
much as divides them, – e.g. a property line, or the border between two
nations, or any two somethings. The limit contains its two sides
ideally. The two somethings are constituted by the one limit. If France
did not border Germany, one could not say what territory it would cover.
If we take the limit away from between two somethings, we just have pure
being again. All the determinacy is in the limit, which constitutes the
division of entitence. Nonentitence, nonbeing, is thus intrinsic to
entitence – and this is precisely the concept of finitude.</p>
<p><strong>Restriction &amp; Ought.</strong> The previous section
contemplated the development of determination, i.e. quality, with
respect to the beings of entitence, namely the somethings, something and
other. This is the relativity, the determination in entitence. That kind
of qualification has achieved completion in limit. The qualification of
the something is its limit, which simultaneously joins it to something
else. Thus, the back-and-forth of something and other falls away when we
reach limit. Something and other had dual character only because they
had separate intrinsic being, though equivocally so. Limit is their
third, and so the relation is stabilized, albeit negative. In other
words, limit is as much the limit of the one as of the other something.
Consequently, it belongs primarily to entitence as such. It is not only
the something which has a limit in it and therefore is finite. Entitence
as such is inhernetly limited and is therefore finitude: “the hour of
its birth is the hour of its death” (Hegel’s gloss on Ecclesiastes 7).
Now the duality in entitence was first in the form of something &amp;
other, two separate entities; then it was determination and
constitution, which are the qualities that qualify something externally,
extrinsically; but this duality (the partitioning of entitence) is
brought to completion in the relation of restriction and ought: the
determination of something is now a restriction on it, an inherent
inadequacy. The fulfillment of the ought, which the finite something
cannot ever attain, is infinite being, eternity. This is the return of
entitence back to being as such, the reversion to pure being.
Termination is inherent in entitence, which is thus finite. To some
people (we call them atheists), it seems as though the finite is all
there is, that the finite is absolute, that there is nothing beyond the
world of separate, transient entities which are limited by each other
and therefore destined to destruction. But in fact, if the finite is
absolute, then it is absolute. In other words, the finite is the finite,
is itself finite. Consequently, finitude as such is inherently limited
and therefore inherently, in and of itself, pass over into the
infinite.</p>
<p><strong>c. Infinity, Bad Infinity, True Infinity</strong></p>
<p><strong>Infinity in general.</strong> It may again seem as if we are
done, as if entitence has been brought to completion, since surely the
infinite is an absolutely affirmative category and thus a return back to
being, a circling back to the beginning of entitence and so the
resolution of the negativity that was there in it from the beginning –
an overcoming of relative qualification, limitation, and termination.
But infinity is at first only infinity in itself, implicit infinity,
from which actual infinity is to be drawn out. Infinity as it
immediately is, the as yet undetermined concept of infinity, has already
been given: it is the negation of the finite. But the real meaning of
this is what is to be developed here.</p>
<p><strong>Bad Infinity.</strong> The infinite is the negation of the
finite. But then it is something other than the finite. Thus, infinity,
which ought to be the absolute in contrast to the relativity of
finitude, immediately relapses into entitence: into the relation of
something and other. This is the finitized infinite. The finite is
entitence, being that has fallen from purity and is mixed with
otherness, qualified, and limited; infinity by contrast is a return to
pure being. (This is the point where we are now circling back to the
pure being of the very beginning.) Finitude is extrinsic being
(being-for-another) and infinity is intrinsic being (being-in-itself).
If manifold entitence is reduced to its in-itself, its intrinsicness,
that is pure, indeterminate being. And this is the beyond of the finite.
This is the progression of bad infinity: the finite (i.e. entitence) is
limited being; it has limitation inherently; but this limitation is a
beckoning to be transcended, a fence that implies a beyond (pure being);
but in going over into this beyond, the finite is left behind, so the
infinite (pure being) is determined, limited, and thus falls back into
the finite. This is the bad infinite, the progression of which is a
perseveration, a futile dialectical see-saw which never gets beyond
finite entitence. It is the alternation or oscillation of finite and
infinite. This kind of contradiction comes up whenever two relative
determinations are driven into opposition. But this oscillation is not
for nothing, not just an error to be avoided: it is in fact the
dialectical genesis of the speculative concept, the true infinity.</p>
<p><strong>True Infinity.</strong> In order to generate the concept of
true infinity, all we have to do is notice that, even as the infinite
becomes finite by being constrained to the other side of the border, so
the finite becomes infinite by ever recurring in the beyond. And this
oscillation, this see-saw, is the witness of the genesis of the true
infinite: the infinity which grasps the finite in it as sublated. The
true specification of the finite is that it is just the two sides of
infinity held apart in reciprocal oscillation, and the true infinity is
what contains and cancels this back-and-forth movement. The
falsification that intellect (διανοία as opposed to reason, νους)
perpetrates in these matters is that it presupposes the two sides as
independently subsisting, which are then brought together externally so
that their unity is only an artificial concatenation. This is really a
failure of learning, a failure to penetrate into the heart of things.
The truth is that rather that in this matter (and in all such matters)
the ostensibly external determinations inherently sublate themselves:
finitude is in-itself the infinite, is only the negative, external
entitence of the infinite, is at no point utterly separate from the
infinite. Their separation is rather something that occurs within the
infinite itself. This is in general how things go with the concept. The
infinite has sublated the finite, and we have thus circled back to pure
being, but with entitence and its entire dialectic sublated and
contained in it. This is self-entitation.</p>
<h3 id="c.-self-entitation">C. Self-entitation</h3>
<p><strong>a. Self-entitation in general</strong></p>
<p><strong>Self-entitation in general.</strong> Self-entitation is pure
being (intrinsic being) with entitence (extrinsic being) sublated in it.
‘Sublated’ means that it has the process of going out (exiting) and
returning (sublating) preserved and canceled in it. Self-entitation has
both being (self) and entitence (entitation) in it, but the being is
entitative and the entitence is in-itself, pure. This means that the
extrinsic being that proceeds from the intrinsic being immanently turns
back into the latter. The extrinsic is now intrinsically intrinsic. Or,
stated yet differently, what goes out now inherently has to come back.
Because it is completed quality, it has the form of freedom. And that is
basically what freedom is: the confidence that what is let loose will
find its way home. That way, it does not have to be on a leash, managed
with bells and so on. This is what self-entitation is: freedom as it
occurs at the most basic ontological level. It is free being (but not
freedom as such, since it is only being and so is still abstract from
thinking). Self-entitation can thus also be called independence: being
which is for itself. That is why Hegel calls it Fürsichsein -
for-itself-being (“you can do it for yourself”). Self-entitation is
indeed for-itself-being, independence and autonomy at the level of
ontology. So it is the beginning of what Aristotle calls ουσία, essence
or substance, the inner core of things or a thing with an inner core. If
pure being is the universal, and being is the particular, then
self-entitation is the singular, the individual. Now the aforementioned
finding-its-way-home is the pointing of being back to unity, and so it
is being-for-one. This is what Aristotle calls πρὸς ἓν, and Hegel calls
Sein-für-eines. E.g., words have many meanings but they all indicate or
point towards its primary meaning. In self-entitation, the element of
being is being-for-one. But there is no other for which it would be. So
the being of self-entitation is for-itself, and thus self-entitation is
the self-entitent, i.e. an entity that is for itself, a one. (This
transition is similar to the above deduction from quality to
something.)</p>
<p><strong>b. One &amp; Many</strong></p>
<p><strong>One &amp; Many.</strong> The one is the something of
self-entitation. The difference consists in this: whereas the
something’s intrinsic being was equivocal with its extrinsic being, the
one has them absolutely in its intrinsic being. The one is the absolute
something. It has no true other, sublates its other-relations, conquers
them. All the foregoing determinations are sublated in the one itself.
All we have to do now is see how they exhibit themselves. The
determination of nothingness, nonbeing, is immediately there in the one
as its internal quality. As entitent, the nothingness is the void. The
void is outside the one. But by positing this outside-itself, the one
has relapsed into entitence. The one is a one, an entitent one in the
void. The self-entitent one is thus the self-entitizing one: the one
entitizing itself in the void. The one multiplies itself into many ones
and is self-entitization. This self-externalization, self-entitization,
is to be called repulsion. Repulsion can be considered intrinsically or
extrinsically: intrinsically, it is the begetting of other entities;
extrinsically, it is what is more usually called repulsion: the
reciprocal deterrence of presupposed entities. In the distinction of one
and many as we have it here, infinity is in two ways which do not as yet
link up: infinity is firstly the repelling one which begets many ones;
and infinity is simultaneously the void, into which the ones are
externalized, but which does not yet constitute any positive
relationality. The one is here simply flowing into the void. This is the
duality of self-entitation.</p>
<p><strong>c. Repulsion &amp; Attraction</strong></p>
<p><strong>Repulsion &amp; Attraction.</strong> In the previous section,
self-entitation, through its intrinsic repulsion, lost its unity in the
entitization of many ones in the void. Thus, the many ones are now in a
thoroughly relativistic way: the loss of the intrinsically repulsive one
has made repulsion into extrinsic repulsion (Hegel: Ausschließen), the
mutual repulsion that starts from many pre-entitent ones. And yet, each
one is still a one, a being with an absolute in-itself. But the
in-itself of each of these disparate ones is the same in-itself. Each of
the many ones is inwardly the One, i.e. the distinguished one, the
exalted one. Their multiplicity is therefore external, extrinsic, and
indeed is the void itself. Repulsion is truly the void, extrinsicness as
such; and the intrinsic, the absolute in-itself, is now what Hegel calls
‘the One one’, which is the coalescence of ones: attraction. But
attraction is not simply the abstract negation of many ones. Then they
would disappear in the One one. Rather, attraction is just as much
sublated repulsion: the ones accumulate, so that the mutual attraction
of ones is an addition or summation. The one that attracts gains in size
and volume through its attracting. For its part, repulsion is the
negative comportment-to-another. But this ricochets off the other and
sends the one back into itself. And the in-itself of each one is the One
one, so repulsion is immediately the same movement as
attraction-into-one. And the one is, as said, in-itself the repulsion of
many, so attraction and repulsion are each in-themselves the same as
their opposite. With this we have reached the completion of quality, the
absolute quality. It is unity, but not as statically entating unity, but
rather as self-entitizing unity: self-entitation as self-consolidation.
This is the final result: being is truly the one that multiplies itself,
but in multiplying itself it does not lose its unity, because its
multiplication is intrinsically already its self-consolidation. The
truth is that being is inherently self-consolidating.</p>
