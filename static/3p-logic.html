of Hegel’s Logic</h1>
<h2 id="version-i">Version I</h2>
<p>Being is the sensible, empirical side of reality. It consists of
quality and quantity (Aristotle’s ‘poion’ and ’poson’ respectively).
Qualia (e.g. shiny, red, apple) constitute the content of sensible
reality, but in a form which is generally recalcitrant and unreceptive
to combination (shiny cannot be added to heavy). Quanta (e.g. 5, 9,
etc.) constitute the combinability of sensible reality, but a formal
combinability abstracted from all content (e.g. addition, subtraction,
ratio, etc.). Measure is the combination of quality and quantity
(e.g. 100 books in a library, 2 atoms of hydrogen), and it constitutes
the field of sensation and experience. But this field is still the
external combination of qualia and quanta. Their inward union is
substance, essence.</p>
<p>Essence is the invisible, formal side of reality. This form is
identity-in-difference. First, essence is formal thinking, the empty
formal identity of itself with itself. These are the laws of thought
(e.g. A = A). Second, essence is the difference between itself and its
manifestation. This is the difference between the formal laws of nature
(e.g. F = ma) and their manifestation in sensible being (e.g. the
movement of planets around the sun). Third, essence is the
identity-in-difference of the form, the law, and its manifestation, its
being. This is actuality, the infinite rejoining of essence with itself
in its existence (e.g. the seed manifests on the tree in the fruit; seed
= tree = fruit). This triune circle, this infinite self-rejoining
movement, is the concept.</p>
<p>Concept is essence fully entered into being and thus become present
to itself. It is thinking, but no longer as merely formal thinking, but
a thinking which has all reality in it as its own self-production. This
is the ‘I’ of self-consciousness, but a divine ‘I’. In itself this is
the content of traditional logic (Aristotle’s Prior Analytics). As
externally projected, the concept is an objective end apart from itself
to which it relates (Aristotle’s ‘telos’). When this end is brought back
into the concept, then we have the end in itself, the idea. The idea is
the philosophical method, self-knowing truth, and imperishable life. It
is the creator of nature, the unity of truth and goodness, and the
purpose of being. This is the Absolute Idea or Word of God.</p>
<h2 id="version-ii">Version II</h2>
<p>In the sphere of being, everything is what it is immediately.
What-ness (essence, determination) is dissolved in that-ness (being,
immediacy). On account of this immediacy, something cannot alter without
becoming something else entirely. Determination, what-ness, is here
quality. When what-ness is distinguished from that-ness, and this
distinction is itself taken as immediate, mechanical, then we have
quantity, being which is indifferent to what-ness (qualitative
determination). Quantity is extension and quality is what-ness. The
emergence of quality in quantity (e.g. the paradox of the heap) is thus
the transition from being into the essence of being. In general, being
is the sphere of unmovedness.</p>
<p>In the sphere of essence, what-ness and that-ness are at once
distinguished and connected. Essence is thus being in and for itself. In
itself because distinct from mere being, and for itself because
connected to it. The connection here is however dyadic, essence appears
in another. The course of essence is that it fully enters into being so
that the difference is sublated. In the sphere of being, being
(that-ness) went out in extension and withdrew into what-ness. This
retraction of being into itself is reflection. Reflection is first pure
mediation (A = A). Reflected out of itself it is existence. The uniting
of essence and existence is actuality. This uniting is itself a
reflection, in which essence is bent through a series of increasing
manifestations in existence: whole and part, inner and outer, substance
and accident, cause and effect, power and act, which culminates in the
reciprocity (chemistry) of passive and active substances. In general,
essence is the sphere of movement, but moving another.</p>
<p>The concept emerges at the point where essence and existence coincide
as a result of the reflection. So that what is reflected in the
reflecting is the reflection itself. Self-reflection. That is, the
movement of reflection bends the essence back into being, so that
reality becomes the effectivity of reflection (thought), and thought is
revealed to be the one substantive being. This self-thinking being is
the universal concept, which is the ‘I’ of self-consciousness, but a
divine ‘I’. Freely exercising its power to disseminate and recuperate
its moments, the concept becomes the object, the end. When the end is
bent back into the concept, this is internal telos: the idea, the
end-in-itself. This is first life, and then knowledge, but a finite
knowledge in which the true and the good are distinct. The unity of
truth and goodness is the method, the truth, and eternal life. This is
the unmoved mover, the Absolute Idea or Word of God.</p>
<h2 id="version-iii">Version III</h2>
<p>First of all, reality is 1. being. Being is basically static reality
without intrinsic operation. It is real, but not operatively real, and
so subject to passing away. Change in being is the destruction of being.
Being is presence, but transitory presence. Secondly, 2. transient being
is taken back into the enduring essence. Essence endures change, because
its nature is to be intrinsically operative and moving. But it is not
real. Essence is only virtual being, being in the form of non-being. It
reveals itself, makes itself present, by actualizing itself in being. So
we have transient static reality on the one hand, and enduring virtual
motion on the other. The virtual operation reveals itself in its
transient beings, which are constantly passing away. Then thirdly, 3. we
have the essence which is actual as essence. It is real, actual, like
being. And it is enduring and operative like essence. But it doesn’t
reveal itself by positing itself in transient being. Rather, it is its
own positing. It is self-positing being, being which actualizes itself
into itself. It is immanently active and actual. And infinitely so,
since this is the definition of God. This is the concept. The concept is
actual as essential. It is the actual virtuality. The the virtuality
which is real as virtual. It is the human ego, the ‘I’ of
self-consciousness, which is fully actual as the presence of virtuality
in existence. This is in its fullest expression the God-man, Jesus
Christ. Being is reality, but powerless to maintain itself. Essence is
virtuality, power, but realizes itself by falling into transient being.
Concept is virtuality which is real as virtual; the virtual, the power,
which has made itself power, whose actualization is its virtualization.
Or being is reality, which is basically inoperative, so its change is
its passing away. Essence is operation, which consequently endures
change (because it is change), but which is not real, whose reality is
only through transient things. Concept is the operation which real as
operational, real as virtual, whose reality is its activity, and whose
operation is its existence. This is God.</p>
<h2 id="version-iv">Version IV</h2>
<p>Being is that-ness, the matter of fact that something is. And essence
is what-ness in general, the form of what something is. But in the
science of logic we are concerned, not with the being of this or that
thing, and not with a certain kind of form or other, but rather with
being as such, pure that-ness, and form as such, pure what-ness.</p>
<p>Now that-ness and what-ness are related as matter and form, and
likewise as potency and activity. Matter is the possibility for being
something. And form is the actuality of it, which includes the operation
of it. For example, a hand detached from a body is not an actual hand,
because it doesn’t work (energeia). The pure essence is in fact pure
operation, to be what it is means to be operational. And pure being is
just pure potency, the possibility for being operative through and by
essence/form. And the essence/form does the determining: form is
formation. So being and essence are related as fact and act: that-it-is
and (actively-being-)what-it-is.</p>
<p>Being is the matter of thought, pure content. And essence is the form
of thought, pure operation. But this form is the propositional form, the
formula for which is A = A. This is this. Or, commonly: that is a dog,
that is a table, etc. On the left we have the indeterminate that-being
(being), and on the right is form/identity of that thing (essence). But
both are the same thing, just one side is in the form of being, and the
other is in the form of essence.</p>
<p>This is how things stand in the theory of essence. There’s a
determinable something on one side (which is the being) and then there’s
a reaction against it, which asserts the form (the iterable, repeatable
essence) on the other side. And this determination is a reaction against
the tranquility of just being. The potency for determination (what is
this thing?) is disrupted by this negative determining of the form which
irrupts within the unformed being. It is actually being’s own
self-movement which causes this irruption, which makes it (the “that”)
negate itself into some determinate identity (the “what”). This is the
process by which being all of its own transforms itself into thinking,
which is the unity of what-ness and that-ness, essence and being.
Thinking is rather the essence, the operation, which is intrinsically
real, and whose determination is not a reaction or irruption from within
mere being, but rather is one with its being and establishes itself as
the foundation of reality, a status which it gives to itself by its own
operation. Concept is the foundation which makes itself the foundation,
the actuality which actualizes into itself.</p>
<h2 id="version-v">Version V</h2>
<p>The logic of being consists of what Kant called the ‘mathematical’
categories (quality, quantity). These are the forms that content is in
as content, minimally formalized content. These are the instrument of
empirical science, the forms that the data of the empirical world are in
as data. The standpoint of consciousness which corresponds to these
forms is dogmatism: it takes the truth to be just what it experiences in
the world outside it. Here, thinking is passively receptive with respect
to the object. The object is disorganized on this account, lacking inner
unity, and thus appears in forms which are only externally combined, and
not inwardly united.</p>
<p>The logic of essence consists of what Kant called the ‘dynamical’
categories (relation, modality). The first section of essence, ‘essence
as reflection within’, is the pure form of thinking, the propositional
form in abstraction, A = A. The rest of the logic of essence consists in
the contentization or materialization of the pure form, i.e. minimally
reified form. This is the logic of natural science by which it organizes
the data of experience into a systematic whole. The standpoint of
consciousness which corresponds to essence as the formal side of logic,
is skepticism: it doesn’t take the world (being) as immediately
revealing its true nature, but reflects on it, discovers its inner
systematic unity (its essence). Here thinking is active with respect to
the object, actively constituting the object. The categories here are
doubled, mirroring each other, mutually interpenetrating each other and
reciprocally potentiating each other. One side is taken as form, the
other side as content; one side as cause, the other as effect, and so
on.</p>
<p>The logic of concept is the unity of essence and being, form and
content, thinking and what is thought about. This is in a sense God, the
Absolute, but it is the self-reverting being, self-thinking being. This
is logic as such, pure self-thinking thought. Not formal thought, but
thought which has the same structure as its content, which produces its
content out of itself. If being is called mathematical, and essence is
called dynamical, then the categories here may be called teleological,
because they are the form which brings itself into being, the effect
which is its own cause, and so on. These categories correspond to the
teleology described in Kant’s Critique of Judgment. This is the thinking
which overcomes and sublates the standpoint of dogmatism (being) and
skepticism (essence). This is the standpoint of philosophical
science.</p>
<h2 id="version-vi">Version VI</h2>
<p>Hegel’s Logic is fall and redemption. Being is the Garden of Eden,
where thinking is immediately united to truth (God). Essence is
withdrawal of truth into a beyond and the ascendency of semblance
(Schein). Concept is the salvational return (parousia) of truth
(essence) to being.</p>
<p>Every existing tree is a fall and redemption. The seed is the Garden
of Eden, wrapped up in secure immediate unity. It falls apart into the
externality of space and time, into the many branches and leaves. But
the truth (seed, essence) returns in the end to redeem the whole
tree.</p>
<p>The meat of the fruit is like the Paraclete who guards, protects, and
comforts the heart (the core, cordial) of the apple in its presence in
externality and exposure to the elements (evil).</p>
