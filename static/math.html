Hegel</h1>
<p>It is sometimes thought that Hegel’s system of science, and its
foundational text the Science of Logic, is an interesting yet ultimately
unprovable exercise in metaphysics, which lacks the precision and
necessity of empirical science and formal logic, and therefore that the
order of the categories in the Logic is arbitrary. This assessment is
not true. The structure that Hegel is describing in his Logic is a
precise and necessary structure, indeed it is the necessary structure,
the ground framework of reality and the basic pattern of all thinking
and being. There are perhaps many paths that can be taken to enter into
Hegel’s thinking and become convinced of its truth, but in this essay
which is intended for beginners I have opted to take the route that
Plato took twenty-four hundred years ago in his lecture ‘On the Good’ to
the Athenian people, and begin with a detour via mathematics.</p>
<p>Everyone knows since grade-school that there are six basic arithmetic
operations: addition and subtraction, multiplication and division, and
power and root. Now addition and subtraction can be understood as a kind
of multiplication, in which only one number is taken as a potentiator.
For example, in the calculation 5 + 4, we obtain the result 9 by
counting the numbers contained in the latter addend (1, 2, 3, 4), and
for each of these numbers, we augment the former addend (the number 5)
by 1. So we start with 5, and then for each of the units contained in 4,
we augment 5 by 1, thereby retrieving 9. So addition and subtraction can
be understood as multiplication operations in which only one factor is
operational. The meaning of multiplication and division is thereby
revealed to be this: the mutual potentiation of two numbers. When we
multiply 5 times 4, for each of the units contained in but not including
the number 4 (1, 2, 3), we augment 5, not by 1 but by 5. The power or
potency of one number is combined with the power or potency of another,
so that they potentiate each other. Each number is made more powerful by
the other. Now the meaning of the square (e.g. 3²) is revealed: the
number potentiates, not another number but itself. The stronger the
number is, the more it potentiates itself, the more it grows. So we
have, in addition and subtraction, a one-directional or one-sided
potentiation; and then in multiplication and division we encountered a
mutual or reciprocal potentiation; and finally in the square (or power
generally) we arrived at self-potentiation. The square can also be
analyzed back into its factors through the square root (because it has a
kind of necessity which is absent in addition, multiplication,
etc.).</p>
<p>What does this have to do with metaphysics? Here is where things get
interesting. In the 9th century an Irish philosopher named John Scotus
Eriugena wrote a book called Periphyseon or ‘The Division of Nature’.
His work bears striking resemblance to Neoplatonic thought (especially
Proclus), though he probably did not have access to those texts, and his
knowledge of Neoplatonism was mediated by Christian mystics such as
Dionysius the Areopagite. Anyway at the beginning of Periphyseon
Eriugena says that nature as a whole can be divided or carved up into
four divisions: things can be either, 1. created and not creating, 2.
created and creating, 3. uncreated and creating, or 4. uncreated and
uncreating. The fourth of these divisions is superfluous and can be
eliminated. Now if creation is taken as a kind of potentiation, then we
have the following triadic series: 1. one thing potentiates another
thing, but this other thing is passive and not itself potentiating, 2.
one thing potentiates another thing, which is itself potent, and so they
are reciprocally or mutually potentiating, and 3. what is potent, but
potent with respect to itself, and thus is self-creating,
self-potentiating. Examples of the first would be atoms, rocks,
mountains, water, space and time, nebulae, etc. Things that are
basically just passive material but have been produced as a result of
some other process. Examples of the second category would be things that
are roughly living, in the broad sense of just active and potent: the
sun, weather, plants, animals, nuclear reactions, chemical reactions.
These are examples of mutual potentiation. And in the third category we
have those natural things which are self-potentiating, which are active
and alive, but not with respect to another but to themselves: human
beings, states, social groups, etc.</p>
<p>I have put these interesting observations about mathematics and the
division of nature into juxtaposition in order to draw out the analogy
between them. The structure of nature as a whole is a reflection, that
is an image or analogy, of the structure of mathematics, which is
quantitative logic. Logic is the structure of the natural world, and the
natural world has logic as its skeleton. Thus it is also observed that
Eriugena’s division reflects the academic division of the natural
sciences into physics, chemistry, and biology. Physics studies the
motion of bodies in space and time: outer space, atoms, and other beings
that are in external and mechanical combinations with each other.
Chemistry studies the inner affinity of substances for each other, their
mutual potentiation. And biology studies those substances which have
attained a degree of independence and self-subsistence. And at a higher
level, Eriugena’s division corresponds to the Neoplatonic triad of
being, living, and thinking. Outer space consists of that realm of
things which simply are, but are not alive, and thus are external to
each other, caused but not actively causative; Earth is that realm in
which there is a reciprocal interaction of cause and caused, and living
things in general are reproducing themselves through another; and third
is the human world: the civilizations that human beings have created for
themselves are explicitly self-created worlds, worlds which are
self-contained and self-reproducing. Though they are within nature, they
have achieved the status of something unconditioned, i.e. uncreated.</p>
<p>The analogy between mathematics and the structure of nature is highly
edifying, because it demonstrates that the sciences have a much higher
degree of systematic interconnectivity than is usually assumed. In fact
we name the study of this systematic interconnectivity of science,
philosophical science. And Hegel is that philosopher who carried this
science further than anyone else. The Science of Logic describes the
content of formal logic, mathematics, systems theory, metaphysics,
syllogistic logic, and theology in terms of the basic triadic structure
which was seen above in the concept of arithmetic. The whole of the
formal sciences (logic in the broadest sense) may be divided into 1.
those that bring content in general into external connection and
combination, without considering the operation itself as internal to the
content, and 2. those operations by which the content brings itself into
relation to other content intrinsically, so that the inner affinity of
the content is brought out, and 3. that formal operation which is
operative on itself, so that the form is the content and the content is
the form, and there is a development of this thinking from out of
itself, self-developing thinking. Hegel calls these: 1. being, 2.
essence, and 3. concept respectively. Being is that phase of reality
according to which things simply are, without any internal potency. So
any kind of activity or operation on being must come to it from outside,
as we described above with addition and subtraction (which was external
or one-sided potentiation). Examples of formal logical operations
appropriate to mere being would be conjunction and disjunction, unions
of sets, and counting. Essence is that category of cognition according
to which things are intrinsically potentiating, but potentiating other
things. The basic metaphysical categories here are cause and effect. In
formal logic, these are conditionals and biconditionals. The connection
between atoms or nebulae in space falls in the sphere of being, because
they are just externally conjoined. The relation between microorganisms,
seeds and trees, etc. falls in the sphere of essence, because they are
mutually potentiating. The third category of reality is called concept,
which is that potency which is actual as potency because it is
self-potentiating. It actualizes into itself, because its essential
nature is self-reversion (Proclus’s ‘epistrophe’, and Fichte’s
‘self-positing ego’). Its existence just is this reversion into itself.
And this is the human mind. The concept is basically virtual reality:
human thought, cognition as such. The virtual which is real as virtual.
This is a self-reversion which is active in respect to itself. The
formal logical structures which correspond to the concept are modality:
possibility and necessity. Because what is necessary is self-causing,
related only to itself and not dependent on another (as we saw with
square and root above). The concept is a causal relationship bent back
into a circle.</p>
<p>At the highest level, all of science divides into a triadic
structure: 1. formal science, which deals with pure thinking,
i.e. logic, reason, the Logos; 2. natural science, which is the thinking
of external objects and created beings, and 3. human science, which is
the thinking of thinking things, i.e. of the Logos or reason as returned
back to itself within nature, the creature which has the Logos or
reason. Now the whole of science can be imaged (reflected) as a tree. 1.
Logic (formal science) is like a seed, the universe in itself, as a hard
and inflexible singularity. 2. Nature is like the tree which emerges
from the seed, for which the seed was only a formal blueprint or ground
plan, which develops out of itself into externality, where there is a
degree of contingency and fungibility. 3. Spirit (human science) is like
the fruit, which is the seed returned back to itself in the externality
of the tree (e.g. man is the rational animal).</p>
<p>A final comment may be made before we bring this brief beginner’s
introduction to a close. We started by considering the series of
ordinary arithmetic operations. Three things need to be noted about this
series: firstly that it is a triadic development which goes from simple
to complex, or from abstract to concrete. Secondly, that the operations
come in pairs, where one is the opposite of the other. And thirdly that
the operations can be deduced from each other: multiplication can be
deduced as an extension of the principle which was implicit in addition
and subtraction, and the power and root can be deduced as an extension
of what was implicit in multiplication and division. Putting this all
together we may conclude with this remark: the philosophical
comprehension of the operation which is truly involved in simple
mathematics, and the philosophical deduction of the content of pure
arithmetic in and of itself, consists in a dialectical derivation which
proceeds through the interconnection of opposites, and proceeds from
what is most abstract to what is most concrete, and by progression from
external combinability or one-directional potentiation to reciprocal
potentiation and achieves completion in self-potentiation. That is
all.</p>
