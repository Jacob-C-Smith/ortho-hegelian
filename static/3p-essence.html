Paragraph Summary of Hegel’s Theory of Essence</h1>
<p>Essence is the negation of being. Being was immediacy, presence,
inoperation, unthinking. Essence is the opposite: mediation, absence,
operation, formal thought. The distinctive feature of essence is that it
is constituted by the difference between itself and being (e.g. Gregory
Bateson: “The organism is the difference between itself and its
environment.”). The operation between them is ‘reflection’, for which
the basic metaphor is light insofar as it bounces back and forth and
reveals things. There are three things to consider about reflection:
first, that it is similar to induction, genesis of the abstract
universal, the eternalization of the transient content of sensible
being; second, that it is the operation of the pure essence itself which
does this to being; and third, that it is also the putting (positing) of
the essentialized content back into being. An example of reflection from
the organic realm would be floral mimesis (plants assuming the
appearance of their environment). A purely logical example would be the
conversion of a statement of immediate fact (‘opium is making me
sleepy’) into a generalization (‘opium has the dormitive virtue’). The
course of essence is that reflection as such enters into being so that
reflection becomes restful and being becomes self-reflective. But first
we begin by considering (1.) pure reflection, the operation of essence
within itself. Here we find immanent reflection; external reflection,
which comes over sensible being from the outside (e.g. external
comparison, likeness and unlikeness); and determining reflection.
Determining reflection forms the basis for (2.) the so-called laws of
thought: identity (A = A), difference (A ≠ -A), and contradiction (A =
-A). These laws are absolute generalizations from all content, but in
the form of reflection, and thus essentializations of all content. The
fourth law is (3.) the law of sufficient ground (cf. Leibniz).
Everything has a ground. Lightning is the ground of the fire which
destroys a town; low wages are the ground of the strike. Grounding is
the completion of pure reflection, the operation of the empty essence as
law in general. Next, essence comes into relation with concrete being
(the natural world).</p>
<p>Appearance considers essence as the latter comes into relation with
concrete being, the world of natural existence. First we thus have to
consider (1.) concrete being, existence. Existence is minimally
essentialized being, being which has the structure of reflection. This
is a thing with properties. As its etymology suggests, a ‘thing’ is an
assembly of beings (qualities), gathered together into one being which
owns them. The difference between being and existence is the difference
between being and having (Aristotle’s ‘echein’). In the sphere of being,
if something lost its quality it ceased to be entirely. But a thing
maintains its identity when its properties change. Next we have (2.) the
order of general laws set over against the order of things. Order of
explication vs. order of being (ordo cognoscendi and ordo essendi). Laws
are universals, general principles (e.g. the laws of Newtonian
mechanics, F = ma) that govern the order of things, which constitutes
the appearance of the laws (e.g. the solar system). Existence is
minimally essentialized being; the laws of nature are minimally reified
essence. ‘F = ma’ is a law because it has universal applicability which
ranges over diverse appearances, whereas ‘1 oxygen + 2 hydrogen =
water’, while definitely holding in general, is immediately united to
its being and does not stand over it as a ground. (This is the precise
middle point of the whole Logic, where being is explained by thinking,
reflection, but thinking is not yet entered into being and become
self-thinking being, the concept.) The laws of nature require proof, and
this proof is to be found only in observation. The two orders are thus
intrinsically identical, and we have (3.) the essential relation. These
are the three different ways in which the essence relates to its
appearances. These are: a) whole and its parts, b) force and its
expression (e.g. magnetic force, gravity, etc.), and c) the relation of
inner and outer. Essence is inner, existence is outer. The identity of
inner and outer is the revelation of essence: there is nothing left over
in the essence which is not manifest. This is actuality, being which is
intrinsically operative.</p>
<p>Actuality is the identity-in-difference of essence and appearance. If
essence is the seed, and appearance is the tree, then actuality is the
fruit, the seed rejoining itself in its existence (Aquinas’s ‘ipsum esse
subsistens’). This is the concept, but here considered from the side of
essence only, and thus as a form of reflection. We thus start with (1.)
the empty absolute. The absolute is what is ordinarily called ‘God’, but
here as empty abstractum (Spinoza’s absolute substance). The absolute
consists of attributes, each of which is the whole absolute (res extensa
and res cogitans in Descartes). The absolute is their operation: going
out of itself and returning back into itself (Aquinas’s ‘exitus et
reditus’; everything comes from God and returns to God; also, Proclus’s
triad of abiding-proceeding-reverting). This is (2.) actuality as such.
The forms of actuality are the modalities, which exhibit the following
progression: a) contingency and formal possibility (the possible worlds
of analytic philosophy), b) real possibility and actuality (Aristotle’s
‘dynamis’ and ‘energeia’ – e.g. the seed is potentially the tree), and
c) absolute necessity (’it is because it is’, cf. Exodus 3:14). Now we
are on the threshold of the concept. Necessitation is (3.) absolute
correlation, which has three forms: a) substance and accident, b) cause
and effect (or creator and creation), and c) reciprocal action.
Substance is Aristotle’s ‘ousia’, being which is not predicated of
another. Causality is the action of one substance on another
(Aristotle’s ‘poiein’ and ‘paschein’) - necessitation from beyond. The
definition of God as merely causal substance corresponds to the
unrevealed, irrational God of judaism (sphere of being is to paganism as
sphere of essence is to judaism). When causality is bent back into a
circle so that necessitation becomes self-necessitation and substance
becomes causa sui, this is the higher conception of God: the creative
power that acts by being acted on, creates by being created, and
consequently whose creativity is self-revelation and infinite communion
with itself. This is freedom, the concept.</p>
