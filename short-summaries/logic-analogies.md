# Logic Analogies
## Hegel’s Objective Logic as a tree:
1. Quality - a leaf
2. Quantity - the number of leaves
3. Measure - the proportion of leaves to branches, to trunk, to seed, etc.
4. Essence - the seed
5. Appearance - the emergence of the tree from the seed
6. Actuality - the genesis of the fruit on the branch, i.e. the return of the seed in the tree
## Hegel’s Objective Logic as a programming language:
1. Quality - variables, strings, data types (pure content)
2. Quantity - numbers, decimals, numerical operators
3. Measure - arrays, lists, sets
4. Essence - functions (pure form)
5. Appearance - objects, loops, control flow
6. Actuality - classes, higher order functions, etc.
## Hegel’s Objective Logic as formal logic:
1. Quality - boolean and conjunction (†, ¬, ∧, ∨)
2. Quantity - arithmetic (+, -, ⋅, ÷)
3. Measure - set theory and proportion (∪, ∩, :)
4. Essence - identity and difference (=, ≠)
5. Appearance - conditional (→), biconditional (↔︎)
6. Actuality - possibility (◇) and necessity (□)
